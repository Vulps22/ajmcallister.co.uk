            <p>Vortex Evader was created from scratch in Java with no pre-existing framework or game engine. It initially started off as a little project to refresh my Java skills, however it quickly became something of a suitable quality to release.</p>
            <p>Initially develpopment followed a tutorial series that i have long since lost track of, and after about 2 and a half videos from this series, I began to make my own changes. By the end of the 3rd video, I had decided to break away from the tutorial and build my own game</p>
            <p>By the time I had abandoned the video, Vertex Evader had a simple game loop, the player token could move and the enemies could not bounce. I then added damage, health, score, levelling, bouncing enemies and more using ChatGPT for assistance whenever I hit a problem i didn't know how to resolve</p>
